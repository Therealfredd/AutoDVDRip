# AutoDVDRip

A very basic python script to automate DVD Ripping using MakeMKV on Windows. 

Should be able to just keep running and change DVDs when they're done and the script should automatically go onto the next one. 



## Before Running

Make sure to install MakeMKV.

```bash
  https://www.makemkv.com/
  
  Check this directtory is correct:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\MakeMKV\makemkvcon64.exe
```

Tested on Python 3.9 but should work on almost any version. Nothing special used. 


Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Therealfredd/AutoDVDRip
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd AutoDVDRip
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Running:
```bash
python3 main.py PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER
```
